This project is for finding a photo of a person on large scan.

I had to crop very large amounts of nice and plain photos for documents (e.g. passport photo) that were scanned as A4 documents.
So I've written this tool to find a face on the scan and crop it around.

This script relies on the presense of [68 face landmarks predictor](https://github.com/AKSHAYUBHAT/TensorFace/blob/master/openface/models/dlib/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat).
